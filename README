 This is the logo for the \textbf{WI}reless systems, \textbf{N}etworks and cyber\textbf{S}ecurity laboratory of  the Department of Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University, http://wins.ceng.metu.edu.tr. The design of the logo is very simple. The abbreviation of the laboratory is written using the "pandora" font. Except the letter "i", all others are capital. The 5 leaves on top of the letter "i" represent Seshat, the Ancient Egyptian goddess of wisdom, knowledge and writing. Seshat is generally represent with a seven-pointed emblem. However, we used five in the logo and represented the seven-ness in the radiating antenna pattern with seven waves that also emphasizes the research scope of the laboratory. 

Seshat according to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seshat), under various spellings, was the \textbf{Ancient Egyptian goddess of wisdom, knowledge, and writing}. She was seen as a scribe and record keeper, and her name means she who scrivens (i.e. she who is the scribe), and is credited with \textbf{inventing writing}. She also became identified as the goddess of architecture, astronomy, astrology, building, mathematics, and surveying.  Mistress of the House of Books is another title for Seshat, being the deity whose priests oversaw the library in which scrolls of \textbf{the most important knowledge were assembled} and spells were preserved.  In art, she was depicted as a woman with a \textbf{seven-pointed emblem} above her head.  Seshat assisted the pharaoh in the "\textbf{stretching the cord}" ritual. This ritual is related to laying out the foundations of temples and other important structures in order to determine and assure the \textbf{sacred alignments and the precision of the dimensions}.  Much of \textbf{this knowledge was considered quite sacred} and not shared beyond the ranks of the highest professionals such as architects and certain scribes.
